# GoProHero-2014

Here's the script for GoPro Hero 2014 Entry Level Action Cameras that allows you to increase the TimeLapse intervals.

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Save both autoexec files to the root directory of your GoPro Hero 2014 memory card.
2. If they have automatically placed the extension .txt at the end of each filename, you will need to remove this so they have the extension .ash
3. The only file you will need to edit is the autoexec2.ash file and the only thing you will need to change is the sleep number. This number represent seconds, so changing it to 30 will give you a time lapse with a 30 second shot interval.
4. Do not edit the files with NotePad on windows. Use an editor like NotePad++ or Sublime as these programs will keep the formating correct.
5. Do not remove the last line that is blank from either file. If it is removed, the GoPro will not run the script. 
6. If the script does not load when you start your GoPro, then try using a clean memory card without any files or folders except for the two autoexec script files.



**DISCLAIMER:** Even though this script is pretty non-volatile,  this will almost certainly void your GoPro warranty. There is also a small chance that you could brick your GoPro. I won't be held responsible if anything screws up.
